            <strong>What is this app?</strong><br>
            This app implements what is called a Serial Reaction Time task.  Research indcates that this tyoe of task is a good way of measuring aspects of attention that may be affected by acute or chronic sleep loss.  This app implements a 3-minute reaction time task, with random time intervals (between 2 and 10 seconds) between trials.  The app will store your data in your phone, and over time you will be able to compare your current performance with your performance on previous occassions.
